Using value specifications to record the values of entity qualities and other measurables reduces the need for a plethora of data properties. 

Here are cases where we promote value specifications over data properties:

For these reasons, OBI has a handful of data properties (including `has value` and `has specified value`), and a set of measurement / setting / prediction datums and the material entity qualities that they are about, drawn from PATO and other ontologies. Below, value specifications are used to supply catagorical values, units are provided, and qualities of parts of organisms are unambiguously described.
